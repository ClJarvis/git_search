# GitSearch

This project is a Repo search using the gitHub API. The current version shows a user's avatar and some of their repos that have open issues. 

## Usage

The intent is for the user to search for repos with open issues. Each repo will appear in its own card with a description and an open issue count. The user can then click the url to go directly to the repo's open issues. 

## Tech

React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, GitHub's API

## Theme

Colors are based on gitHub's dark mode with a gradient background the starts dark green and transitions to medium green and back. The more results, ie more repos with open issues, the longer the page is.
An earlier version has a brighter green but I decided it was just too bright on screen. Now the color transition is more subtle.
